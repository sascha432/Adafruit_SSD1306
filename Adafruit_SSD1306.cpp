 * @mainpage Arduino library for monochrome OLEDs based on SSD1306 drivers.
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is documentation for Adafruit's SSD1306 library for monochrome
 * OLED displays: http://www.adafruit.com/category/63_98
 *
 * These displays use I2C or SPI to communicate. I2C requires 2 pins
 * (SCL+SDA) and optionally a RESET pin. SPI requires 4 pins (MOSI, SCK,
 * select, data/command) and optionally a reset pin. Hardware SPI or
 * 'bitbang' software SPI are both supported.
 *
 * Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
 * please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
 * products from Adafruit!
 *
 * @section dependencies Dependencies
 *
 * This library depends on <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library">
 * Adafruit_GFX</a> being present on your system. Please make sure you have
 * installed the latest version before using this library.
